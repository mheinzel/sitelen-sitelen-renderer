# Sitelen

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

The library requires including a single minified JavaScript file and additional styling in the `head` of your web page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/sitelen-sitelen-renderer.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/sitelen-sitelen-renderer.min.js"></script>
```

After that `HTML` elements with the `data-sitelen` attribute are parsed and rendered into toki pona if possible, with the `data-sitelen-ratio` attribute you can inidcate your preferred height-to-width ratio of the rendered sitelen sitelen. 

```html
<section data-sitelen data-sitelen-ratio="1">
    ale li jo e tenpo. ale li pona.
</section>

```

## Motivation

I created Sitelen Sitelen Renderer because I am fascinated by combining the artifical language Toki Pona with the non-linear writing style 'Sitelen Sitelen' by Jonathan Gabel. Unlike other work with Sitelen Sitelen I want the writings to be generated by the computer. My [first attempt](http://nullelement.org/2015/05/living-toki-pona-using-flexbox-layout-and-sitelen-sitelen/) was in the beginning of 2015 when I experimented with CSS Flexbox using SVG for the Glyphs. The algorithm was limited and doomed so in October 2015 I started anew, and set out to create SVG-only sitelen sitelen that can be exported and reused. This is still a hobby project that I work on in my spare time.

## Installation

Install the project with bower:

```
$ bower install sitelen-sitelen-renderer
```

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## Examples

[Live input of Toki Pona](http://livingtokipona.smoishele.com)

On this page you can type (proper) Toki Pona. The text is parsed into structures that can be rendered in the style of Sitelen Sitelen. By hovering at the top of the glyphs you can choose the form that you like. You can even download the self-contained SVG which you can then use wherever.

Also check out the Toki Pona [proverbs](http://smoishele.com/sitelensitelen/examples/proverbs/proverbs.html) from Sonja's book generated by Sitelen Sitelen Renderer.

Mind that this project is very much in alpha, many language constructs are not implemented yet. If you find them you can add them to the issue list. Soon, I want to release this as an easy to use library for converting Toki Pona text on your site to Sitelen Sitelen automatically.

Cheers!


## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Contributors

This live sitelen sitelen web project is made possible by the great work done work before me.

[Toki Pona](http://tokipona.org/) is an artificial language invented in 2001 by Sonja Lang as an attempt to understand the meaning of life in 120 words. In my own search, I am convinced this language should not be used to translate large bodies of text or as an actual means of communication but as a personal tool for soul searching.
        
[Sitelen Sitelen or Sitelen Suwi](http://www.jonathangabel.com/archive/2012/projects_t47.html) is a project created by Jonathan Gabel in 2012 who created a non-linear writing style for Toki Pona inspired by Mayan script. I try to keep the algorithm behind the Sitelen Sitelen Renderer in the spirit of Jonathan's project and allow for the different ways of drawing the sitelen sitelen.
        
The [vectorized glyphs](http://forums.tokipona.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&p=13786#p13786) are based on the excellent work by jan Same. To make my SVGs scalable I sadly had to get rid of the non-uniform stroke widths. Also I have slightly different ideas about how to use the containers so I took the liberty of slightly altering some glyphs.

If you want to contribute in any way, you can for instance file issues you find or come up with clever new ways to put sitelen sitelen into action.
